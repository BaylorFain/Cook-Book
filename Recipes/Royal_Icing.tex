Dry Ingredients
\begin{itemize}
    \item 4 tbps meringue powder (If not using egg whites)
    \item 16 oz powder sugar (454 g)
    \item 1/4 tsp cream of tartar
\end{itemize}

Wet Ingredients
\begin{itemize}
    \item 3 oz egg whites (If not using meringue powder)
    \item 1 tsp vanilla
    \item 1 tbsp corn syrup
\end{itemize}
\end{multicols}
\end{scriptsize}

\begin{footnotesize}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Make sure bowls are grease free or icing may not reach correct consistencies 
    \item In a bowl mix dry ingredients
    \item Gently mix in wet ingredients
    \item Beat for 4-6 min or until stiff peaks
    \item Divide icing in to individual bowls for each color needed
    \item Add gel coloring a drop at a time, until shade is correct
    \item Slit each color in half. Use one half to pipe the boundaries of a design and thin the other half to flood large single color areas with in a boundary
    \item To thin a color to flood consistency, add a 1/2 to 1 tsp of warm water at a time. Icing is ready when a glob (on a flat surface) takes 8-10 sec to spread flat
    \item Use a pointy object to help move flooded icing around and lightly tap the cookie on the working surface to help the icing settle
    \item Allow icing to dry for 6-8 hr before eating or adding another layer of icing
